        <li>FunkySquad is an insiprational project made by three friends wanting to do something about Blockchain. It's more than squad... FunkySquad will make
            new projects almost every year and it aims on taking over the Metaverse with awesome art!<br><br />

            On June 13th 2022, one guy from a friend group was talking about his Bored Apes, and he decided to show his pals some. They wanted to make similar project
            and all three agreed on making "Elf Girl" collectibles, knowing that people would buy it for little price.
            They started making their "Elf Girl Funky Squad" project and got even more ideas about some future projects. Anything is possible, that is their motto.
            They are not doing this for money, but fame and passion. It's not just a project, it's an art.<br><br />
            
            The Elf Girl Funky Squad project will set to release on X/Y/Z with about 10,000 Elfs on the OpenSea. Every year, at least 1 project from this squad
            would be released as an authentic art or collectibles. See you soon!</li>
