Being an freelancer, Superyo knows the thing, knows how everything about the internet works. His importance in this project is high, without him you wouldn't be able to read this and won't be that interested into getting in this project. From him being an average programmer now he has a wide mind into getting on the NFT projects like this. You know, the master. (apache/apachi, twitter.com/cssuperyo)";
