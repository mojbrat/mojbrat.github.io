                    IntelRealms Metaverse Program (referred as IMP) is a custom ethereum-host network that storages all the NFTs we've made. IMP storages all the owners and transfers of our NFTs and is not open to the public.
                    We will not steal any information from our right owners of our NFTs.
                    Our NFTs can be used anywhere as a right owner. Users that purchased our NFTs can use them as their profile pictures, backgrounds, etc.
                    Usage is in all owner's right, we are not responsible for other users using owner's NFT somewhere without permission. OpenSea shows who the real owner is, and OpenSea is the only right place to trade our NFTs.
                    Alpha Laboratories, Inc. and elf-world.com crew allows its rightful owners to use their art (NFT) anywhere they want without needing a permission.
                    Granting permission to use NFTs is by buying one on the marketplace (OpenSea.com). Editing the existing NFT is possible, but uploading the same NFT to the marketplace would be considered fraud and will be reported to OpenSea's Staff.
                    IntelRealms Ownership Security Program (IR-OSP) is an subnetwork of IMP (IntelRealms Metaverse Program) that displays the real owners of any NFTs we use. Our NFTs are uploaded to only 2 networks, OpenSea Market and IR-OSP systems.
                    It would be considered illegal to upload our NFTs to the other networks that are not supported or legal by the law of United States and European Union. Any kind of illegal actions that people commit can only be used against the owners of the same NFT, not the company or IMP.
                    You can sign an contract with Alpha Laboratories, Inc. or IntelRealms, Inc. to apply for multiple ownership of your NFT so our companys copyright law apply for your NFT.
